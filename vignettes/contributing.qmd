# How to Contribute

Before reading this article, we recommend familiarizing yourself with the [overview of how Lifelihood works](overview.html).

## Introduction

This document outlines the guidelines and steps for contributing to the **Lifelihood** R package. Contributions from the community help improve functionality, address bugs, and ensure that **Lifelihood** remains robust and up-to-date. This guide covers setting up your development environment, working with Git, and submitting changes.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

To start contributing, you’ll need to set up a local development environment where you can modify, build, and test **Lifelihood**. Follow these steps to get started:

- **Fork the Repository**

- **Clone Your Fork Locally**: run the following command in your terminal, replacing `yourusername` with your GitHub username:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Lifelihood.git
cd Lifelihood
git remote add upstream https://github.com/nrode/Lifelihood
git checkout -b feature-name
```

- **Install Development Dependencies**: install all necessary dependencies for development, including **Lifelihood** itself, by running:

```r
install.packages(c("devtools", "testthat", "roxygen2", "pkgdown"))
remotes::install_local(dependencies = TRUE)
```

## Make changes

All R source code resides in the `R/` directory, and only these files are included in the package.

After making changes, you can verify that everything works as expected by running:

```r
devtools::load_all()
```

This allows you to work with `lifelihood` functions using your latest local modifications.


## Documenting

Documentation for **Lifelihood** is managed with **Roxygen2**. If you add or modify functions, update the documentation by running:

```r
devtools::document()
```


## Testing and Validation

**Lifelihood** includes a suite of unit tests located in the `tests/` directory. These tests help ensure that changes don’t break existing functionality. Run tests using:

```r
devtools::test()
```

Ensure all tests pass before submitting a pull request. Adding new tests for new features or bug fixes is highly encouraged.

## Code format

In order to ensure consistent code style, it's recommend to install [Air](https://posit-dev.github.io/air/), an R formatter. The documentation with it has tutorials on how to set up it in your IDE (RStudio, Positron, VS Code, etc).

## Submitting a Pull Request (PR)

Once your changes are complete and tested, submit a pull request to propose integrating them into the main **Lifelihood** repository:

Add, commit and push your branch to your fork on GitHub:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m 'commit description'
git push origin main
```

Then go to your project fork and click on the "Open a pull request" pop-up.

When a pull request (PR) is opened, GitHub Actions will **automatically run checks** to validate your changes. These checks include testing the codebase, ensuring consistent documentation, and verifying cross-platform compatibility.

You can view the status of these checks directly in the pull request interface.
