\arguments{
\item{row}{A row of the dataframe object provided by the user (\code{df} argument in \code{\link[=lifelihoodData]{lifelihoodData()}} function).}

\item{sex}{Column name containing the sex of the
observations.}

\item{sex_start}{Column name containing the first
date of the interval in which the sex was determined.}

\item{sex_end}{Column name containing the second date
of the interval in which the sex was determined.}

\item{maturity_start}{Column name containing the first
date of the interval in which the maturity was determined.}

\item{maturity_end}{Column name containing the second
date of the interval in which the maturity was determined.}

\item{clutchs}{Vector containing the names of the clutch
columns. The order should be: first clutch first date, first
clutch second date, first clutch clutch size, second clutch
first date, first clutch second date, second clutch clutch
size, and so on. If the observation with the most clutches
is, for example, 10, then the vector must be of size 10 x 3 = 30
(3 elements per clutch: first date, second date and size).}

\item{death_start}{Column name containing the first date of
the interval in which the death was determined.}

\item{death_end}{Column name containing the second date of
the interval in which the death was determined.}

\item{covariates}{Vector containing the names of the covariates.}

A string of the well formated row.
