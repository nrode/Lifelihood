\arguments{
\item{df}{Dataframe with the data of life history. It
should have one row per life history / observation.}

\item{sex}{Column name containing the sex of the
observations.}

\item{sex_start}{Column name containing the first
date of the interval in which the sex was determined.}

\item{sex_end}{Column name containing the second date
of the interval in which the sex was determined.}

\item{maturity_start}{Column name containing the first
date of the interval in which the maturity was determined.}

\item{maturity_end}{Column name containing the second
date of the interval in which the maturity was determined.}

\item{matclutch}{Whether the maturity event (designated by
\code{maturity_start} and \code{maturity_end}) is a clutch event or not.
If \code{TRUE}, must specify the \code{matclutch_size} argument. Default
is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{matclutch_size}{Column name containing the size of the
clutch for the maturity event. Only used (and required) if
\code{matclutch} is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{clutchs}{Vector containing the names of the clutch
columns. The order should be: first clutch first date, first
clutch second date, first clutch clutch size, second clutch
first date, first clutch second date, second clutch clutch
size, and so on. If the observation with the most clutches
is, for example, 10, then the vector must be of size 10 x 3 = 30
(3 elements per clutch: first date, second date and size).}

\item{death_start}{Column name containing the first date of
the interval in which the death was determined.}

\item{death_end}{Column name containing the second date of
the interval in which the death was determined.}

\item{covariates}{Vector containing the names of the covariates.}

\item{model_specs}{Vector of characters with the name of the
statistical law to use. Must be of length 3 and each element
must be one of "wei" (Weibull law), "exp" (Exponential law),
"gam" (Gamma law) or "lgn" (Log-normal law). The first one is
used for maturity, the second one is used for clutchs and the
third one for death.}

\item{path_config}{A character string specifying the file path to the YAML configuration file.}

\item{temp_dir}{Name of the temporary directory with temporary files}
}
\description{
Takes a dataframe (\code{df} argument in \code{\link[=lifelihoodData]{lifelihoodData()}} function)
and apply to each row the \code{\link[=format_row]{format_row()}} function to create the
input data file.
